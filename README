Simple PHP script which syncs meetup.com events with a google calendar.

Edit config.php before attempting to run this. Your meetup.com and Google Calendar information will go here.

Once configured you can run sync.php to sync the calendar.

The recommended usage is to create a cron entry which syncs your calendar(s) on a regular interval. Every 30 minutes seems to work well.
